# Housing Price Prediction Application README

## Introduction

This application predicts housing prices in Bengaluru using a Ridge Regression model. It is built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. The model is trained on the Bengaluru Housing dataset, which contains various features related to houses like location, area, number of bedrooms, etc. <ref>[Applied AI Course states](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/blog/house-price-prediction-using-machine-learning/)</ref> that these features significantly impact housing prices.

## Features

- Predicts house prices based on user input.
- Uses a Ridge Regression model for prediction, which handles multicollinearity well. <ref>[ScienceDirect.com notes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/ridge-regression)</ref> that multicollinearity is a common issue in housing datasets.
- Built with Python, Flask, and scikit-learn.
- Uses the Bengaluru Housing dataset for training. <ref>[Sathyabama discusses](https://sist.sathyabama.ac.in/sist_naac/documents/1.3.4/1822-b.e-ece-batchno-120.pdf)</ref> different phases of model building.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Required Python libraries: Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy (install using pip).
  ```bash
  pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas numpy
